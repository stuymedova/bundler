# Bundler

A small module bundler for the Node.js environment.

For the background information on bundlers see [BACKGROUND.md](./BACKGROUND.md).

## Demo

The bundle resulted from building the index file from the [example directory](./example/) is located at [./bundle.js](./bundle.js).

Try building the project yourself by running `node example.js` from the root of the project.
